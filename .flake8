# Rules structured from https://github.com/python/typeshed/blob/main/.flake8
# The following rules are incompatible with or enforced by Black:
#     E203   whitespace before ':' -- scripts only
#     E301   expected 1 blank line
#     E302   expected 2 blank lines
#     E305   expected 2 blank lines
#     E501   line too long

# Some rules are considered irrelevant to stub files:
#     B      All flake8-bugbear rules are .py-specific
#     E701   multiple statements on one line (colon) -- disallows "..." on the same line
#     F401   imported but unused -- does not recognize re-exports
#            https://github.com/PyCQA/pyflakes/issues/474

# Rules that are out of the control of stub authors:
#     E741   ambiguous variable name
#     F403   import *' used; unable to detect undefined names
#     F405   defined from star imports
