<!--

  are submitting, cross it out and check the box nonetheless to let us know.
  For example: - [x] ~Changelog~
- Regarding the changelog, often it makes sense to add your entry only after code
  review is finished. That way you might prevent conflicts from other PR's in
  that file, as well as keep the chance high your description fits with the
  latest revision of your feature/fix.
- Regarding documentation, bugfixes often don't require additions to the docs.
-->

- [ ] Documentation (update `README.md`)
- [ ] Changelog (add an entry to `CHANGELOG.md`)
- [ ] Tests
